Cost Data Ingestion for Universal Ads




Cost data is a critical part of understanding the full ROI of your ad campaigns. By automatically importing ad campaign costs, Branch is able to show you powerful calculated metrics including Total Cost, eCPI (Effective Cost Per Install), ROAS (Return On Ad Spend), and more in your Branch dashboard.



We are excited to announce that all Universal Ads customers now have access to cost data for for Facebook, Google Ads, Apple Search Ads, and Snap campaigns, with additional network integrations planned!

Keyword-level Google Ads attribution, and full Parallel Tracking compatibility
On October 30th, 2018, Google rolled out a technical change to click tracking for web campaigns called Parallel Tracking. Our team has performed extensive testing, and can confirm the Branch links and the existing Branch web SDK are fully compatible with Parallel Tracking â€” customers do not need to make any changes.



If you have further questions about Parallel Tracking, please reach out to our support team: support@branch.io.



PS, thanks to our unprecedented cross-platform visibility, Branch is able to show keyword-level attribution for app activity. While testing for Parallel Tracking compatibility, we also updated our guide to web measurement. If you aren't currently getting keyword-level attribution reporting, this is a great time to review your Branch web implementation!





Branch analytics tags now automatically pass through to UTM parameters
By popular request, we've added some new functionality to improve cross-platform analytics tag management.



It works just like you'd expect: when a Branch link redirects to a web URL, analytics labels will now automatically pass through as UTM parameters.



~campaign > utm_campaign

~channel > utm_source

~feature > utm_medium



We hope this small improvement will help simplify your analytics tagging across every platform!
