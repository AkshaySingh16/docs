## Overview

Configuring Twitter install ads to use Branch links is very simple. The only trick is that you will be using the website click/conversion ads instead of the standard app install ad. Using Branch links allows you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.


## Setup

1. Visit the [Marketing page](https://dashboard.branch.io/quick-links) on the Branch dashboard and click **+ Add link**.
2. Create a link, and fill in values for **campaign** and **channel**. Make sure to add deep link data.
