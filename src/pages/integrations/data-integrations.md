## Overview

Data Integrations provide an easy way to automatically send Branch data to your other analytics services and marketing tools using pre-formatted webhooks. For most integrations, configuration just requires you to input your credentials and hit “Enable”.

!!! note "Data Feeds is a paid product"
    Data Integrations are included in Branch’s Data Feeds offering, which can be purchased according to Branch’s [pricing schedule](https://branch.io/pricing/), and which is available at no additional charge to customers who already pay for Journeys, Deep Linked Email, and Universal Ads. If you would prefer not to purchase Data Feeds, you can still export Branch data in CSV form directly from the Branch dashboard.
