## Overview

Data Feeds is Branch’s premium suite of tools for exporting data. If you want to export your Branch data programmatically or send your data to other analytics services, Data Feeds can help. It includes the following tools:

- [**Data Integrations:**](https://docs.branch.io/pages/integrations/data-integrations/) pre-built integrations with other analytics services and marketing tools. Just input your credentials and Branch will automatically send your data to any of our integrated partners.
- [**Webhooks:**](https://branchmetrics.github.io/docs/pages/exports/ua-webhooks/) fully customizable templated webhooks that send Branch data to the endpoint of your choice in near-real time.
- [**Data Export API:**](https://branchmetrics.github.io/docs/pages/exports/api-v3/) an API that will allow you to pull CSV files containing all of your Branch data from the past week.

!!! note "Data Feeds is a paid product"
    Data Feeds can be purchased according to Branch’s [pricing schedule](https://branch.io/pricing/), and is available at no additional charge to customers who already pay for Journeys, Deep Linked Email, and Universal Ads. If you would prefer not to purchase Data Feeds, you can still export Branch data in CSV form directly from the Branch dashboard.
