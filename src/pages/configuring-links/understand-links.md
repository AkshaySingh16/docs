## Analytical behavior

#### Analytical tracking

  - Whenever a user `clicks` on a deep link and `opens` the app
  - This triggers either an `install` or an `open`
      + `installs` represent Branch recognizing the app_id and device_id for the first time
      + `installs` represent new app users and the success rate of your Branch deep links
      + `installs` do **not** represent App Store downloads
      + `non-Branch installs` are installs outside of Branch deep link clicks
      + `opens` are non-installs
      + If a user uninstalls and reinstalls the app, this will be an `open` because Branch recognizes the device
      + If a user has the app and clicks a Branch deep link, this will be an `open` because the user is not new



## Link data

#### Structure

  - Deep link data structure

    ```js
    {
      tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ],
      channel: 'facebook',
      feature: 'dashboard',
      stage: 'new user',
      alias: 'myalias',
      data: {
        mydata: 'something',
        foo: 'bar',
        $desktop_url: 'http://myappwebsite.com',
        $ios_url: 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
        $android_url: 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
        $og_app_id: '12345',
        $og_title: 'My App',
        $og_description: 'My app\'s description.',
        $og_image_url: 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
      }

  - Branch reserved keys

    | Prefix | Usage |
    | --- | --- |
    | $ | Branch reserved keyword
    | ~ | Branch analytical data
    | + | Branch added values

#### Analytical labels

  - For [Create Deep Link](#create-deep-link) and [Share Deep Link](#share-deep-link)

    | Key | Default | Usage
    | --- | --- | ---
    | channel | | Use channel to tag the route that your link reaches users. For example, tag links with `'Facebook'` or `'LinkedIn'` to help track clicks and installs through those paths separately
    | feature | | This is the feature of your app that the link might be associated with. For example, if you had built a referral program, you would label links with the feature ‚Äòreferral‚Äô
    | campaign | | Use this field to organize the links by actual campaign. For example, if you launched a new feature or product and want to run a campaign around that
    | stage | | Use this to categorize the progress or category of a user when the link was generated. For example, if you had an invite system accessible on level 1, level 3 and 5, you could differentiate links generated at each level with this parameter
    | tags | | This is a free form entry with unlimited values `['string']`. Use it to organize your link data with labels that don‚Äôt fit within the bounds of the above
    | alias | | Specify a link alias in place of the standard encoded short URL e.g. `yourdomain.com/youralias`. Link aliases are unique, immutable objects that cannot be deleted. You cannot change the alias of existing links. Aliases on the legacy `bnc.lt` domain are incompatible with Universal Links and Spotlight
    | type | `0` | Must be an `int`. Set to `1` to limit deep link to a single use. Set to `2` to make the link show up under [Quick Links](https://dashboard.branch.io/marketing) while adding `$marketing_title` to `data`. Does not work with the Native SDKs.
