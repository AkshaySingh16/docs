## Overview

iOS Universal Links route directly to your app when opened, bypassing the web browser and URI scheme combination typically used for the redirection process. Universal Links were introduced with iOS 9, and became the only fully-functional deep linking option on iOS after [Apple stopped supporting URI schemes for deep linking in iOS 9.2](https://blog.branch.io/ios-9.2-redirection-update-uri-scheme-and-universal-links).

!!! warning "Universal Links are critical on iOS!"
	You must enable Universal Links before Branch can function correctly on iOS 9.2+ but note that pure iMessage apps don't support Universal Links.

Branch makes it simple to enable Universal Links all while greatly improving on them, offering full attribution, supporting edge cases where Universal Links fail (common) and allowing you to deep link when the user doesn't have your app installed.
