!!! warning "Invite from Organization Required"
	For any Agency to access a Branch account, an invitation from an Admin user at the [Organization](/dashboard/organization-level-access/#adding-an-agency) level is required.

	An Agency does not have access to Organization level functionality, like the ability to change their own permissions, access billing or SSO.

The "Agency" level of a Branch account is a second tier level which allows a third party Agency - both a Full Access and/or Limited Access Agency - to access aspects of the Branch account and includes access (either edit or read-only) to the following functionality:
